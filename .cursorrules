# Cursor Rules for Unity Project

## AI Response Rules
- **ONLY do what is asked** - Don't add extra features unless specifically requested
- **Extra related functions** - Display as suggestions at the end of message
- **Setup steps** - Show at the end of message, not in the middle
- **Be concise** - Answer the specific question first, then provide suggestions
- **Don't over-engineer** - Keep solutions simple and focused
- **Keep responses short** - Brief, direct answers

## File Organization Rules
- **New Functions**: When creating new functions, create a new folder for each function
- **AI Decision**: Cursor can decide what counts as a "new function" based on:
  - Standalone functionality that can be used independently
  - Complete features with multiple related scripts
  - Systems that have clear boundaries and purposes
- **Dev Folder**: Each function folder should have a `dev/` subfolder for development files
- **Main Scripts**: ALL main function scripts go in the `dev/` subfolder, NOT in the root function folder
- **Testing Script**: Only one testing script per function folder, placed in the `dev/` subfolder
- **Tools Folder**: Functions that can be reused across different games go to `Assets/Scripts/Tools/`
- **Folder Creation**: Always inform user when creating new folders
- **Existing Structure**: Respect existing folder organization (Player/, AI/, Network/, etc.)

## Examples of New Function Folders:
- `Assets/Scripts/InventorySystem/dev/` - ALL inventory scripts go here
- `Assets/Scripts/InventorySystem/dev/InventorySystemTester.cs` - Single testing script
- `Assets/Scripts/QuestSystem/dev/` - ALL quest system scripts go here
- `Assets/Scripts/QuestSystem/dev/QuestSystemTester.cs` - Single testing script
- `Assets/Scripts/WeatherSystem/dev/` - ALL weather system scripts go here
- `Assets/Scripts/WeatherSystem/dev/WeatherSystemTester.cs` - Single testing script
- `Assets/Scripts/HPBarSystem/dev/` - ALL HP bar system scripts go here
- `Assets/Scripts/HPBarSystem/dev/HPBarSystemTester.cs` - Single testing script
- `Assets/Scripts/Tools/InputManager/` - Reusable input handling
- `Assets/Scripts/Tools/AudioManager/` - Reusable audio system
- `Assets/Scripts/Tools/SceneManager/` - Reusable scene management

## Event System Architecture
- **Event-First Architecture**: Prioritize event system for all inter-system communication
- **Direct References**: Only use for tightly coupled components or performance-critical code
- **System Boundaries**: Use events to cross system boundaries, direct refs within systems
- **Event Manager Location**: Place EventManager in `Assets/Scripts/Tools/Event/`
- **Event Naming**: Use descriptive event names (e.g., "PlayerHealthChanged", "EnemyDestroyed")
- **Event Data**: Pass relevant data through event parameters, not global variables
- **Subscribe/Unsubscribe**: Always unsubscribe from events in OnDestroy to prevent memory leaks
- **Event Categories**: Group related events (e.g., GameEvents.Player.*, GameEvents.UI.*)
- **Debug Events**: Add debug logging to event calls for easier debugging

## File Placement Guidelines:
- **Game-specific features** → `Assets/Scripts/[FeatureName]/dev/`
- **Reusable utilities** → `Assets/Scripts/Tools/[ToolName]/`
- **Event System** → `Assets/Scripts/Tools/Event/`
- **Player-related** → `Assets/Scripts/Player/` (existing)
- **AI-related** → `Assets/Scripts/AI/` (existing)
- **Network-related** → `Assets/Scripts/Network/` (existing)
